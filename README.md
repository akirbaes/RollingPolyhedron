## Unlimited Net Drawer

### Useful for: checking the path of a polyhedron

Left and Right to choose a poly out of Johnsons, Platonics, most Archimedeans and some Prisms

Up and Down to choose the starting face

Click to roll and cover the space

Enter to take a screenshot

## tiling_drawer.py

### Useful for: creating a tiling dict manually based on an image

Mousewheel to change shape

Left click to add a cell

Right click on a cell to remove it and its children

Right click on an edge to link it to another edge

Once all edges are linked, it will prompt you to save the net under a name.

## tiling_visualisation.py

### Useful for: visualising a tiling

Plots tilings and makes a screenshot

Might need to change the default values

## tiling_dicts

A folder with tiling dictionaries for a lot of tilings!

## poly_dicts

A folder with net dictionaries for a lot of polyhedrons!

## NetDrawer

I used this to find back the tessellation net based on the net. Basis for tiling_drawer and Unlimited Net Drawer

## main.py

Rolls whatever shape I chose in the space, with marks for orientation. Very unreadable. Work in Progress!

## IsohedralTileRollExplore

Turns a tiling into a coordinates system and explores it while coloring based on coordinates. Work in Progress!

## Tilenet explorer

Just a concept, nothing written yet. Work in progress...

Roll a shape on a tiling, decide where to start, keep track of symmetries... Nice ideas.
